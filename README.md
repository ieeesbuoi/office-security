# How to start
First of all, you need arduino IDE. Arduino IDE can be downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Arduino IDE has two basic parameters, port and arduino version. You can specify those parameters from the main menu. To choose the port you have to physically connect the arduino using a usb cable.

# Coding
The arduino coding consists of two main blocks. The first one is setup() which runs only ONCE and the second one is loop() which runs as a loop. You can upload to arduino some basic code (like hello world in other programming languages). This code is called blink because it blinks every one second the onboard LED in your arduino UNO. To open a sketch (program) that blinks go to your IDE and from the menu select, File/Examples/Basics/Blink. You can verify that your code is correct with the verify button and upload to arduino with the upload button.

You can find here build in examples like blink: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples
Simple isn' t it? ;)
